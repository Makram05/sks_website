    <section class="about-content">
      <p>At <span class="highlight">SKS Fashion Zone</span>, every stitch, every design, and every item tells a story of passion, perseverance, and pride. The name "SKS" isn’t just an acronym—it’s a tribute to a person, <strong>Syed Khasim Sab</strong>, a man whose life was defined by overcoming adversity and uplifting others. His journey from humble beginnings to becoming one of the most respected entrepreneurs and influential leaders in Kadapa is the foundation of our shop, and we carry his legacy forward with every piece we offer.</p>

      <p>Born in 1935, my father’s early years were marked by hardship. Losing his mother at just 10 years old, he became the pillar of his family, taking on the responsibility of caring for his two younger sisters. Despite the challenges life threw his way, he never wavered in his dedication to kindness and generosity, feeding the hungry and helping those in need without hesitation.</p>

      <p>A self-made businessman, he built one of the leading timber businesses in Kadapa, all while serving his community as a dedicated politician for over 30 years. His work as the president of Patha-Kadapa for a decade earned him respect not just as a businessman, but as a man of integrity, courage, and unwavering support for the poor. His loyalty to the Congress party and his bold leadership have left an indelible mark on the community.</p>

      <p>Today, <span class="highlight">SKS Fashion Zone</span> is a reflection of his indomitable spirit. Our clothing collection is designed to offer you more than just style—it’s about celebrating life’s triumphs, standing tall through challenges, and embracing the future with boldness. Whether you’re looking for something classic, trendy, or timeless, our pieces embody the very essence of hard work, compassion, and success.</p>

      <p>At <span class="highlight">SKS Fashion Zone</span>, we’re more than just a fashion destination—we’re a place where history meets modern style, where every garment is a tribute to the values of resilience, generosity, and excellence that my father lived by. Step into our world, and be part of a legacy that continues to inspire.</p>
